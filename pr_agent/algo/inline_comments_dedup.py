"""
Stable-marker deduplication for inline PR comments.

When PR-Agent re-runs /improve or /add_docs on the same PR, each run would
otherwise post fresh inline comments for suggestions that were already posted.
This module generates a hidden, content-derived marker that providers embed
in inline comment bodies so that subsequent runs can recognize and update
(or skip) the prior comment instead of creating a duplicate.

# Dedup identity is structured-first, prose-fallback:
#   - If a suggestion has `improved_code`, the hash covers
#     (version_tag + file + normalized improved_code). Prose wording never
#     affects the key, and label is intentionally excluded — the edit
#     itself is the identity.
#   - Otherwise we fall back to (version_tag + file + label + prose prefix).
#
# This is a strict (a) design: prose is NEVER consulted when a structured
# edit exists. Two suggestions at the same spot with the same prose but
# different edits intentionally remain separate comments — we'd rather
# under-merge than over-merge genuinely distinct fixes.
#
# Line-range is deliberately NOT in the key so dedup stays stable across
# upstream pushes that drift the target line (a property the user-facing
# docs explicitly promise).
#
# The version tag (v2s / v2p) lives INSIDE the hashed signature, making
# the two namespaces preimage-distinct and preventing accidental cross-
# namespace collisions. The marker grammar is unchanged, so pre-existing
# v1 markers on live PRs self-heal via the outdated-pass auto-resolve
# (resolve_outdated_inline_comments) on the first re-run after deployment.
#
# A fuzzy near-miss signal (shingle / Jaccard) was considered and deferred;
# see docs/docs/tools/improve.md and the Serena memory
# `future_fuzzy_inline_dedup`.
